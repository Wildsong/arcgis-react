# logseries

Produce primitive charts of log file data from Esri ArcGIS Server
to help chase a problem.

I was already doing some charting
for COVID19 when the need arose to look at some Esri log files
so there are still files in this folder
left over from that.

## What I learned

The logs to look at are actually the web adaptor logs ha ha ha ha oops. 

## What is here

esri_logs.py - Parses one log file and returns filtered data in a list.

read_logs.py - Displays plots of data from all available log files.

## To Do

Turn it into a real app.

Housecleaning, get rid of COVID19 files.
